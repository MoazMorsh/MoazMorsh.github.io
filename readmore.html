    <p>I’m a dedicated data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. My expertise lies in Excel, SQL, Python scripting, web scraping, and creating interactive dashboards using tools like PowerBI, Looker and Apache Superset. 
        I enjoy building automated solutions to streamline workflows and support informed decision-making.
        </p>
    <p>Over time, I’ve worked on various projects such as developing web scraping scripts to extract product data, building dashboards to track business performance, and automating reports to uncover trends and issues quickly. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenges that allow me to solve real-world problems with data.</p>
